# Console Wars
![Thumbnail](thumbnail.png?raw=true "Console Wars")

A small topdown shooter in the console which is multiplayer over the network.

The purpose of this project was to practice programming in C++ and get experience with network programming. Additionally, it's a fun challenge writing a real time rendering system in the Windows console.

The game should theoretically be playable with any number of players, but it has been tested with up to 3 players.

Controls:

Move: W, A, S, D

Shoot: SPACE

Place block: F

The active map will be the text file named "current.txt" placed in the maps folder.

Currently, when a player is shot they must restart the app and reconnect to the server in order to respawn.
